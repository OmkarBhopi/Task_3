This project is part of the SQL Developer Internship
Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries. 

I used pgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL) to write and execute different SELECT queries on the emp table created in the previous task.

In this task, I practiced how to retrieve data using various SQL commands including:

SELECT * to display all columns
SELECT column_name to show specific columns
WHERE clause to filter data based on conditions
Logical operators like AND, OR, and BETWEEN to combine conditions
LIKE for pattern-based matching
ORDER BY and LIMIT to sort and restrict result sets

This task helped me understand how to extract, filter, and present data in a structured way using SQL SELECT, and how to combine different clauses for better control over result sets.

The project includes:
a .sql file with all SELECT queries and .pdf file with screenshot images of each output
